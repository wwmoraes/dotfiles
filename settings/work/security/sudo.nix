          ### For instance, absolutely great idea from CISO to ask for sudo password every
          ### fucking time. I've leaked my password to the logs twice in one day just
          ### because of this. Secure, right?
          ###
          ### Now we're back to the standard 5 minutes timestamp.

          ###
          ### Re-enables the option to set environment variables with -E.
          Defaults:${username} setenv

          ### using a graphical application that assigns you to the wheel group to be able
          ### to sudo is so retarded that I decided to risk myself :D
