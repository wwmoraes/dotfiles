### User defaults to fix CISO's approved ™️ copy-pasta from StackOverflow.
###
### For instance, absolutely great idea from CISO to ask for sudo password every
### fucking time. I've leaked my password to the logs twice in one day just
### because of this. Secure, right?
###
### Now we're back to the standard 5 minutes timestamp.
Defaults:{{ .chezmoi.username }} timestamp_timeout=5
###
### Re-enables the option to set environment variables with -E.
Defaults:{{ .chezmoi.username }} setenv

### using a graphical application that assigns you to the wheel group to be able
### to sudo is so retarded that I decided to risk myself :D
